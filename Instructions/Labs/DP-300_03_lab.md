11. In Object Explorer right-click on AdventureWorks and then click on new query. 

 

	![A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically generated](../images/dp-3300-module-33-lab-12.png)

 

12. Execute the following T-SQL query by pasting the text into your query window and replacing 192.168.1.1. with your client IP address from Step 4. Click execute or press F5.

	```sql
	EXECUTE sp_set_database_firewall_rule @name = N'ContosoFirewallRule',

	@start_ip_address = '192.168.1.1', @end_ip_address = '192.168.1.1'
	```
	

13. Next you will create a contained user in the AdventureWorks database. Click New Query and execute the following T-SQL. Ensure that you are still using the AdventureWorks database. If you see master in the database name box below, you can pull down and switch to AdventureWorks.


	![A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically generated](../images/dp-3300-module-33-lab-13.png)

        Click execute to run this command. This command creates a contained user within the AdventureWorks database. You will login using the username and password in the next step.

	```sql
	CREATE USER containeddemo WITH PASSWORD = 'P@ssw0rd!'
	```


14. Navigate to Object Explorer in SSMS and click on connect and then Database Engine

	![Picture 1960831949](../images/dp-3300-module-33-lab-14.png)

15. Attempt to connect with the credentials you created in step 13. 
    You will need to use the following information:  
	-  **Login:** containeddemo   
	-  **Password:**  P@ssw0rd! 
	 
     Click Connect.
	 
     You will see the following error.

	![A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically generated](../images/dp-3300-module-33-lab-15.png)

	This error is generated because the connection attempted to login to the master database and not AdventureWorks where the user was created. Change the connection context by clicking OK to exit the error message and then clicking on Options >> in the Connect to Server dialog box as shown below.


	![Picture 9](../images/dp-3300-module-33-lab-16.png)


16. On the connection options tab, type the database name AdventureWorks.


	![A screenshot of a social media post Description automatically generated](../images/dp-3300-module-33-lab-17.png)


17. Click connect from that screen. This connection bypasses the master database and logs you directly into AdventureWorks, which is the only database to which the newly created user has access.

	![Picture 10](../images/dp-3300-module-33-lab-18.png)
	

## Exercise 2: Authorize Access to Azure SQL Database with Azure Active Directory

1. Navigate to the Azure Portal, and click on your user name in the top right corner of the screen.


	![A picture containing bottle, black, photo, orange Description automatically generated](../images/dp-3300-module-33-lab-19.png)


	Make note of the user name. 
	
	**Note:** A Microsoft account (a user account from Outlook, Gmail, Hotmail or Yahoo, for example) is not supported for the Azure Active Directory administrator for Azure SQL Database. As a workaround, you can create an Azure Active Directory group named DBA and add your user account to it. Alternatively, you can skip Exercise 2.

 

2. In the Azure Portal navigate to your Azure SQL Database server dp300-lab-xx and click on Not Configured next to Active Directory Admin.


	![Picture 11](../images/dp-3300-module-33-lab-20.png)


	On the next screen, click set admin. 


	![A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically generated](../images/dp-3300-module-33-lab-21.png)

	In the Set admin screen, search for your username. When you have found it, click on it to highlight the username, and then click Select. You will be returned to the above Active Directory Admin screen. Click save to complete the process. This will make your username the Azure Active Directory admin for the server as shown below 


	![Picture 12](../images/dp-3300-module-33-lab-22.png)


3. Open SQL Server Management Studio and click Connect > Database Engine. In the server name enter the name of your server. Change the authentication type to Azure Active Directory Universal with MFA.


	![A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically generated](../images/dp-3300-module-33-lab-23.png)

	

	You will be prompted to enter your Azure Active Directory password, and will you click **Connect**, you'll be logged in to your database. 

 

## Exercise 3: Enable Azure Defender for SQL and Data Classification

1. From the main blade of your Azure SQL server navigate to the Security section and click Security Center. 
   [Note that Azure Defender for SQL was formerly called Advanced data security, and the screenshots still reflect the former name.]
   
 

	![Picture 14](../images/dp-3300-module-33-lab-24.png)

	
	Click the toggle switch under AZURE DEFENDER FOR SQL to ON. Click on Storage account.


	![Picture 1032870623](../images/dp-3300-module-33-lab-25.png)


	You may be prompted to create a storage account, unless there already are storage accounts for your subscription and region. You can choose an existing storage account or click + Create new.  Enter a name for your storage account and click OK. 
	
	![Picture 1032870623](../images/dp-3300-module-33-lab-90.png)

	
	Toggle the switch for Periodic recurring scans to ON. Choose an email account to send scan reports and alerts to. Uncheck the box that says “Also send email notification to admins and subscription owners.”
 


	![A screenshot of a social media post Description automatically generated](../images/dp-3300-module-33-lab-26.png)

	Click on Advanced Threat Protection types and review the selections. Leave all of the boxes checked and click **Save** at the top of the screen.


2. Navigate to the AdventureWorks database in the Azure portal by scrolling down in the Overview screen for Azure SQL server and clicking on the database name 



	![Picture 16](../images/dp-3300-module-33-lab-27.png)



3. Navigate to the Security section of the main blade for your Azure SQL Database and click on Data Discovery and Classification.


	![Picture 18](../images/dp-3300-module-33-lab-28.png)

	On the next screen you will see an informational message that says “We have found 32 columns with classification recommendations”. Click on that link.

	
	![Picture 19](../images/dp-3300-module-33-lab-29.png)


	On the next screen. Click the check box next to Select all, and then click “Accepted selected recommendations”. 


	![A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically generated](../images/dp-3300-module-33-lab-30.png)

	

	Click **Save** to save the classifications into the database. 

 

4. Go back to SQL Server Management Studio on your VM. Launch a new query window from the AdventureWorks database and execute the following query.

 
	```sql
	SELECT o.name AS [Table Name]

	,ac.name AS [Column Name]

	,sc.label

	,sc.information_type

	FROM sys.sensitivity_classifications sc

	INNER JOIN sys.objects o ON o.object_id = sc.major_id

	INNER JOIN sys.all_columns ac ON ac.column_id = sc.minor_id

	WHERE ac.object_id = o.object_id;
	```
	

	This query will return the results of your classified columns as shown below.

## Exercise 4: Manage access to database objects

1. In this exercise, you will manage access to the database and its objects. The first thing you will do is create two users in the AdventureWorks database. Open a new query window and copy and paste the following T-SQL into it. Verify that the code has been copied correctly. Execute the query to create the two users.

```sql
CREATE USER [DP300User1] WITH PASSWORD = 'Azur3Pa$$'

GO

CREATE USER [DP300User2] WITH PASSWORD = 'Azur3Pa$$'

GO
```
 

You will note these users are created in the scope of the database. So if you were to try to login with one of these users, you would need to specify the AdventureWorks database in your connection string.


2. Next you will create a custom role and add the users to it. Execute the following T-SQL in the same query window as in step 1.

```sql
CREATE ROLE [SalesReader]

GO

ALTER ROLE [SalesReader] ADD MEMBER [DP300User1]

GO

ALTER ROLE [SalesReader] ADD MEMBER [DP300User2]

GO
```

3. Next you will grant permissions to the role. In this case you are assigning SELECT and EXECUTE on the Sales schema. Execute the below T-SQL to grant the permissions to the role.

```sql
GRANT SELECT, EXECUTE ON SCHEMA::Sales TO [SalesReader]

GO
```
 

4. Next you will create a new stored procedure in the Sales schema. You will note this procedure access a table in the Product schema. Execute the below T-SQL in your query window.

```sql
CREATE OR ALTER PROCEDURE Sales.DemoProc

AS

SELECT P.Name, Sum(SOD.LineTotal) as TotalSales ,SOH.OrderDate 

FROM Production.Product P

INNER JOIN Sales.SalesOrderDetail SOD on SOD.ProductID = P.ProductID

INNER JOIN Sales.SalesOrderHeader SOH on SOH.SalesOrderID = SOD.SalesOrderID

GROUP BY P.Name, SOH.OrderDate

ORDER BY TotalSales DESC

GO
```
 

5. Next you will use the EXECUTE AS USER command to test out the security you just created. This allows the database engine to execute a query in the context of your user. Execute the below query in your query window.

```sql
EXECUTE AS USER = 'DP300User1'


SELECT P.Name, Sum(SOD.LineTotal) as TotalSales ,SOH.OrderDate 

FROM Production.Product P

INNER JOIN Sales.SalesOrderDetail SOD on SOD.ProductID = P.ProductID

INNER JOIN Sales.SalesOrderHeader SOH on SOH.SalesOrderID = SOD.SalesOrderID

GROUP BY P.Name, SOH.OrderDate

ORDER BY TotalSales DESC
```
 

This query will fail, with an error message saying the SELECT permission was denied on the Production.Product table. The role that user DP300User1 is a member of has SELECT permission in the Sales schema, but not in the Production schema. 


However, if you execute the stored procedure in that same context, the query will complete. Execute the following T-SQL.

```sql
EXECUTE AS USER = 'DP300User1'

EXECUTE Sales.DemoProc
```
 

This happens because stored procedures take advantage a feature called ownership chaining to provide data access to users who do not have direct permissions to access database objects. For all objects that have the same owner, the database engine only checks the EXECUTE permission on the procedure and not the underlying objects.
